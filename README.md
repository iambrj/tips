* A tried-and-true principle of functional programming - if you don't know
	exactly what you want to put somewhere in a piece of code, just abstract it
	out and make it a parameter of a function.
* Use critical thinking to carefully reason about everything
* Memorizing a math formula without understanding the intuition behind it is
	like memorizing code without understanding what it does
* Attempting to solve mathematical problems by intuition will stop working as
  soon as the problems become less intuitive than you are used to
* Rule of thumb: avoid functions that might fail without warning
* To download a list of links use `xargs -n 1 curl -O < urls.txt`
* A good proof not only proves a conjecture, but also makes it seem obvious
